# DestinyLFG-Poster
This script posts to www.destinyLFG.com every 30 seconds. Destiny is a game that has end game content that requires a group. www.destinyLFG.com is where players can post and form groups. It is just a running ticker. So the newest posts are on top and the older ones get quickly knocked out of view. It sometimes takes a long time to find a group. I wrote this script so that it would post every 30 seconds until I ended it. That way I can sit back and not have to manually post for 20 minutes straight.

#Disclaimer
I made and used this script about a year ago. It seems www.destinylfg.com has changed their html, so I doubt this script works anymore. I no longer have any interest in Destiny so I am not going to spend the time to fix it.
